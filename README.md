# SLAM_implementation
This project is aimed for implementing a SLAM, with application of OpenCV functions and g2o optimization.

In `VisualOdometry` directory, there`s a non-structural visual odometry, use OpenCV functions to perform ORB keypoints extraction, descriptor computation and matching, PnP solution with RANSAC. 

## TODO: 
* Local Bundle Adjustment with G2O. 
* Local Mapping Bundle Adjustment.
* Global Mapping BA.
